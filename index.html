									<p>What makes a movie e.g. suspenseful, dramatic, or sci-fi, and which words hidden in movie plots can predefine this? The answer to that would help extract significant information from narrative texts and build an automatic system that could produce emotional tags.</p>

It was marked with distinction, and it has received citations from other academic papers based on mention reports at <a href="https://www.academia.edu/" target="_blank">academia.edu</a>.</p>

									<p>The aim was to identify, define, and automatically predict a set of emotions in movies based on their movie abstracts and metadata. This was achieved with a series of steps including data collection and cleaning, descriptive and inferential statistics, data preprocessing, and <b>Machine & Deep Learning</b> tools and models with a core element and focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>

									<p>The problem was treated as a multi-label classification one, and the result was the prediction of emotions in 55,577 unlabelled movies, as well as the identification of correlations between the predicted emotions and users' ratings and preferences.</p>

									<p>Overall, various correlation tests indicated a strong relationship between users' watchlist and their respective emotional tags. It was concluded that the notion of emotion can constitute an important feature in the movie industry with regard to recommender systems and advertising companies for generating, finding, and placing a higher level of personalized content.</p>

										<p>This is a research study on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in the context of Information Retrieval.</p>

										<p>It begins with understanding the basic components of Recommender Systems, such as information behaviour and indexing, description vs. discrimination on document results, and Recommender Systems frameworks and evaluation metrics such as PageRank, Precision, and Recall.</p>

										<p>Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of how a website can be search engine optimized is undertaken with a focus on <b>organic search results</b>. More specifically, by understanding how search ranking results work, I demonstrated how to conduct a keyword research plan, the ways that content can be optimized, and lastly, how to perform a successful SEO evaluation.</p>
											
										<p>Finally, I published an article for that in various developer communities as well as at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/search-engine-optimization-seo-handbook-beginners-dimitris-fanis/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Pulse that you can find and read it here</a>.</p>
